</p>


## Introduction

The PAROL6 control board is the advanced 32-bit controller for 6 AXES robotic arms like PAROL6. It works out of the box with PAROL6 and PAROL6 commander software.

To use PAROL6 robotic arm you will need a PAROL6 control board. The PAROL6 control board is a compact robotic controller. It is by size a little bigger than a pack of playing cards. It allows PAROL6 to be a really small and portable robot without the need for a control cabinet that is usually the size of the whole robot.

## Physical properties

### Dimensions

!!! note

    **Dimensions are in millimeters!**<br />

</p>


### Mounting

3 Holes located on PAROL6 control board are used to mount the PCB. Use M3 screws!

### Cooling

Stepper drivers need cooling. It can be done with nocuta fan or any other 5V tolerant fan that fits the robot. In case of PAROL6 the fan needs to be of these dimensions: 40x40x20

Keep fan current draw around 0.1 A.
Do not go over 0.3 A.

### Stepper driver

Please use stepper drivers that are listed in the BOM. In case you dont buy them from source robotics website you will need to do few modifications to them:

* Remove 2 diag pins 
* Apply thermal cement to attach the heatsink (Link to cement is in the BOM)

!!! Danger

    **ONLY USE STEP STICK THAT ARE SPECIFIED IN THE BOM!**<br />
    **Failing to do so will destroy your PAROL6 control board!**<br />

!!! Warrning

    **YOU NEED TO SECURE HEATSINK TO STEPPER DRIVER WITH TERMAL CEMENT!**<br />
    **Failing to do so will destroy your PAROL6 control board!**<br />
    

### Stepper driver orientation



Stepper drivers need to be placed with respect to this diagram to the PAROL6 control board!<br />
Stepper drivers orientation can be recognised by 2 diagnostic pins!

!!! Warrning

    **Some stepper drivers have diag pins soldered. If they are soldered you NEED to remove them!**<br />
    **If diag pins are on the PCB they are blocked by the capacitors on PAROL6 PCB, and you cant place the modules in. **<br />

!!! Info

    **DIAG PINS SHOULD FOLLOW RED ARROWS ON THE IMAGE BELLOW!!**<br />

## How to upload code

Microcontroller on PAROL6 control board is STM32F446RE. To upload code you need to use STlink device and connect it dedicated CLK, SWDIO, 3V3 and GND pins. You can use jumper cables or [dedicated stlink + cable assembly](https://source-robotics.com/products/parol6-programming-adapter).


## Wiring PAROL6 control board



You need to follow this diagram to wire your PAROL6 robot arm to PAROL6 control board.

<p align="center">

</p>

After sucesssful wiring of the robot it should look something like this. 

Limit switches to 24V and signal. Inductive sensors to 24V, GND and signal.
