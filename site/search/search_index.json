To optimize joint movements, the robot calculates the necessary displacement and direction for each joint. This method generally works efficiently for most arm configurations. However, challenges arise at singularities, which occur when joints reach their limits or when two or more joints align collinearly.</p> <p>At these joint alignments, certain movements within Cartesian space become unattainable, leading to exceedingly high joint velocities.

After powering up, the robot doesn't know its position and needs to be homed. By hitting a limit switch, we determine the robot joint's position based on our knowledge of the limit switch's location, which we have from the CAD model. For example, when we hit a limit switch on Joint 1, we know that we need xxx steps to reach a witness mark or Joint 1's 0-degree position.</p> <p>Now that we know our position after homing and the number of steps required from the limit switch to the witness mark, you might think we're done, right? Well, not quite. To be really precise, after hitting the limit switch, you should observe how many steps it actually takes from the limit switch to the witness mark. Each PAROL6 build may have slight differences due to various printers, tolerance variations, and parts.</p> <p>The Parol6 control board comes preloaded with generic parameters that will work for anyone building the robot.

We are sending commands every 10 ms. but it is not always exactly 10 ms since your PC is not real time machine. Another thing is that steppers cant execute some really small speed moves from the begging and the ends of the speed curve. Because of that positon is missed usually.  How to compensate that? Using the  position curve! Using current positon and commadned positon we calculate how fast you need to go. After that take that speed and add commanded speed from the speed curve and average that.
